    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I've spent the last 20 years of my career helping software development teams deliver consumer-facing products.  Something that has made my job difficult is I don't have a developer background.  This year I decided to learn fullstack development starting with a Udemy course to see if it was something I was interested in transitioning to.  I like it so far and what you see here is my first Capstone project where I create a personal resume. </p>
